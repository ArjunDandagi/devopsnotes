1. diffie hellman algo is being used to generate a symmetric key first
2. both server and client contribute to creation of such key

4. MAC are used to check the authenticity of the messges themselves ( MAC is Message authentication code ) 

5.1. client prvovides its ID ( public key) 
  2. server checks if there is something like that in ~/authorized_keys 
  3. server generaters a random number and encrypt and send it to solve for client 
  4. if client has the private key , it will decrypt it and combine with the secret key ( generated as the symmetric one) and calculates MD5 of it and sends to server
  5. the server matches the value sent after decrypt the user is authenticated 
  
  
  TODO: // understand what exactly is shared during diffie hellman key exchange 
  
  A good place to check the working process is using -vvv
 
  ```
  ssh -vvv  myuser@localhost 
  ```
